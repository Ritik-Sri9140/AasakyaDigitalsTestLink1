1.Fill the 5-liter jug completely.
	Now, the 5-liter jug contains 5 liters, and the 3-liter jug is empty.
		(5-liter: 5L, 3-liter: 0L)

2.Pour water from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until the 3-liter jug is full.
	The 3-liter jug now holds 3 liters, and 2 liters remain in the 5-liter jug.
		(5-liter: 2L, 3-liter: 3L)

3.Empty the 3-liter jug.
	(5-liter: 2L, 3-liter: 0L)

4.Transfer the 2 liters from the 5-liter jug into the empty 3-liter jug.
	(5-liter: 0L, 3-liter: 2L)

5.Fill the 5-liter jug again.
	(5-liter: 5L, 3-liter: 2L)

6.Pour water from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until the 3-liter jug is full.
	The 3-liter jug already holds 2 liters, so it can only take 1 more liter.
	After this step:
		3-liter jug: 3L
		5-liter jug: 4L (because you transferred 1 liter)
Result:
Now, the 5-liter jug contains exactly 4 liters of water.

Step 1: List the first n odd numbers
The first few odd numbers are:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9,......

We observe that the nth odd number is 2n - 1. So, the sequence of the first n odd numbers can be expressed as:
1, 3, 5, ..... , (2n - 1)

Step 2: Express the sum of the first n odd numbers
The sum S of the first n odd numbers can be written as:
S = 1 + 3 + 5 + .......+ (2n - 1)

Step 3: Recognize the pattern and use induction (optional)
We are asked to show that:
S = n^2

Step 4: Proof by induction

1.Base Case n = 1
   S = 1 = 1^2
   The formula holds for n = 1

2.Inductive Step
   Assume that the formula holds for some n = k That is, we assume:
   1 + 3 + 5 + ...... + (2k - 1) = k^2
   Now, we need to prove that the formula also holds for n = k + 1. The sum of the first k + 1 odd numbers will be:
   1 + 3 + 5 + ....... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1)
   Using the induction hypothesis, the sum of the first k terms is k^2, so:
   k^2 + (2(k + 1) - 1) = k^2 + (2k + 1)
   k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2

   Thus, the formula holds for n = k + 1
Since the base case and the inductive step are both valid, by the principle of mathematical induction, the formula:
S = n^2
holds for all positive integers n.

Step 5: Conclusion
The sum of the first n odd numbers is:
S = n^2

				                    --------

The average speed for the entire trip is given by:

	Average Speed = 2*speed1*speed2/speed1+speed2

Where:  
- Speed‚ÇÅ = 60 km/h (from A to B)  
- Speed‚ÇÇ = 40 km/h (from B to A)

	Average Speed =2*60*40/60+40
		      =4800/100
		      =48km/h

Answer:The average speed for the entire trip is 48 km/h


				               Fourth
				              ---------
The area of the whole pizza is:

	Area=œÄr^2
	        =œÄ(10)^2
	       =100œÄ inches
‚Äâ
Since the pizza is cut into 8 equal slices, the area of one slice is:

	Area¬†of¬†one¬†slice =100œÄ/8
	                            =12.5œÄsquare¬†inches

So, the area of one slice is approximately:

	12.5√ó3.14=39.25square¬†inches


				              Fifth
				             -------
The sequence is: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

This is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2.

	First term ùëé=2

	Common ratio r=2

The general formula for the n-th term is:
	Tn=a.r^n-1

For the 10th term (n=10):
	T10=2.2^10-1
	       =2.2^9
	       =2.512
	       =1024
So, the 10th term is 1024.


 				                     Sixth
				                     -------
Each six-sided die has 6 outcomes, so there are 6*6 = 36 total outcomes when rolling two dice.

To get a sum of 7, the favorable pairs are:  
	(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)

There are 6 favorable outcomes.

Thus, the probability is:

	6/36 = 1/6
So, the probability of getting a sum of 7 is 1/6

1. Let
   - Length of the rectangle = L
   - Width of the rectangle = W

2. Perimeter constraint : 2L + 2W = 100L + W = 50
		     W = 50 - L

3. Area (A) formula : A = L*W
		   = L *(50 - L) 
		   = 50L - L^2

4.Maximize area using calculus : 
   - Differentiate A(L) = 50L - L^2                           
   - Set derivative to 0: 50 - 2L = 0   
		 L = 25

5.Find the corresponding width: W = 50 - L 
			    = 50 - 25 
			    = 25 

6.Conclusion:
   - The dimensions that maximize the area are L = 25 meters and W = 25 meters.
   - The rectangle is a square with side 25 meters.

7. Maximum Area:A = 25 *25 = 625 square meters

				                 -------
Let the number of chickens be x and the number of cows be y. 

Step 1: Set up the equations  
- Each animal has one head, so:
  x + y = 20
- Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so:
  2x + 4y = 56 

Step 2: Simplify Equation (2)  
Divide the second equation by 2:
x + 2y = 28

Step 3: Subtract Equation (1) from Equation (3)  
(x + 2y) - (x + y) = 28 - 20
y = 8

Step 4: Solve for x 
From Equation (1):
x + 8 = 20 
x = 12

Final Answer  
There are 12 chickens and 8 cows.

Let the three consecutive integers be n, n + 1, and n + 2.  
Their sum is:  
n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 3n + 3

We can factor out 3:  
3n + 3 = 3(n + 1)

Since 3(n + 1) is clearly divisible by 3, the sum of any three consecutive integers is divisible by 3.  



			                              	Tenth
				                             -------
We are given:  
1. x + y = 10  
2. x^2 + y^2 = 58  

Step 1: Use the identity  
(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy

Substitute the known values:  
10^2 = 58 + 2xy 
100 = 58 + 2xy
2xy = 42
xy = 21

Step 2: Solve the quadratic equation  
Let the numbers be roots of the equation:  

t^2 - (x + y)t + xy = 0
t^2 - 10t + 21 = 0

Solve for t:  
t = 10+sqrt{10^2 - 4.21}/2 
   = 10+sqrt{100 - 84}/2
   = 10+sqrt{16}/2
t =10+4/2

So, t = 7 or t = 3  

Step 3: The values of x and y  
Thus, the two solutions are:  
x = 7,  y = 3  or  x = 3, y = 7
